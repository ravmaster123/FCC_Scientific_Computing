# FCC_Scientific_Computing
Projects done as part of the Free Code Camp Scientific Computing module.
Since the entire replit consists of many files, I have only included the script which I edited myself. To run the programs, go to the link under the individual readme files and paste the code into the corresponding file. The requisite modules may or may not be installed on the on replit by default
